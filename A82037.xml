            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have had the honour late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to receive foure Letters, with the Armies Remonstrance, all from your Excellencies Councel, with which our hearts and Affections doe freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre as well as any, know ing the things therein expressed are just and good, for we doe verily beleeve the bloud of these precious ones which hath been spilt since this warre, even like water on the ground, cryeth aloud for the speed y execution of justice upon all such who shall be found guilty hereof: And as the bloud of the Innocent cryeth loud for justice,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:164831:3"/>so we are confident that many thousands oppressed, groane under their intollerable burthens, having long expected to be eased thereof, which God in mercy give deliverance to all. We are sorry the said Letters came no sooner to our hands before our Fleet was dispersts, which if they had, God permitting, we should cheerfully have improved our inrerest to the utmost to have answered your Excellency, with the Honourable Councels present expectations. But now we are but foure Ships here in the <hi>Downes;</hi> The St <hi>George, Vnicorne, Mary-rose,</hi> and <hi>Fellowship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reasons of our not declaring at present, is namely the Lord Admirals absence from us, for that we thinke our selves obliged in duty to his Lordship, as our Head, to motion the same first to his Honour, hoping to have his concurrence therein, knowing we are bound in Conscience acting under his Lordships power to observe all his just and lawfull Commands. We doe heartily wish and desire there may be a faire correspondency between his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and your Excellencie: That as the Lord hath been pleased to use both your Honours as instruments of much good to these poore distracted shaken Kingdomes; so our prayers shall be, that God Almighty from that fulnesse which is in himselfe, would fill you more and more with himselfe: whereby your Honours hearts, together with all the faithfull, may be united as one man, to live and dye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Cause of God and peoples Liberties, against all oppositions whatsoever. Now as God hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to set this upon our hearts, so we may confidently assure your Excellency the same hath root in the hearts of many other the Commanders of our Fleet, and not only in us and them, but in many other the Officers and Sea-men
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:164831:3"/>under our Respective Commands.</p>
            <p>Thus much we humbly thought our selves obliged to hint forth to your Excellency in answer to these received; and we hope so long (by Gods assistance) as we have hearts and hands, they shall be lift up for Gods glory, and the Kingdomes good, being confident God will perfect his owne worke in his time to his owne glory: for we have had many pledges of his favour and goodnesse in owning your Excellency and that Army, against all the opposition of yours and our enemies. We have likewise seen his power, Love and Goodnesse, to the Fleet under our Generall the Lord Admirall in the late Expedition, even to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men, and astonishment of our enemies. Now the God of Heaven, who is wisedome it selfe, fill your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels with the wisedome that is from above, which is first pure, then peaceable. We shall now humbly beg leave of your Excellency to subscribe our selves as we desire to be,</p>
